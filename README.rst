RxDB
====

RxDB is a prototype pharmacy system backend. The purpose is to provide
record keeping, operations, and decision support for pharmacy staff.

Requirements
------------

 * It should be modular - providing core functionality relevant to most
   pharmacy settings and add-ons or plug-ins that support more
   specialized functionality.

 * The system should support robust search functionality that can work
   with limited information such as the first few letters of a name, a
   phone number, etc. 

 * It should be easy to import and export data.

 * It should provide report data in easily processed formats.
